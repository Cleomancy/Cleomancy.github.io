## CLEOMANCY.GITHUB.IO

This is my junk Github page where I upload anything, wether I want to test things or just come up with temporary measures before pushing them to my [actual website](https://cleomancy.com).

This site in particular serves as a testing ground for my [Hugo theme](https://github.com/Cleomancy/cleogo). I'm testing XHTML redirections.
